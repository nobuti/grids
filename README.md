GRIDS
-----
**Simple, fluid, nestable, flexible, Sass-based, responsive grid system.**

With syntactic sugars to define widths. For example, if you want to define one column of 25% you can write:

	<div class="column twentyfive percent">
       <div class="content"></div>
    </div>

or

	<div class="column one-of-four">
       <div class="content"></div>
    </div>

It is a float based system, to avoid the akwards parts of inline-block display. It is heavily influenced by the work of @marcelinollano at bebanjo and the amazing job of Harry Roberts - @csswizardry. Rocks!
